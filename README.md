# Rollerblading_Buyers_Guide

Hello, my name is Abe Eveland and I am currently a student at Suncoast Developers Guild. August 1st is the scheduled day to present our capstone project. The inspiration for my capstone project comes from my number one hobby - roller blading- . I chose to build a website that will assist people in buying a pair of roller blades. My app will provide information on the various components of roller blades, as well as recommend certain blades for people depending on their preferences.
